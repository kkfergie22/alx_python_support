# Code Challenges and Practice:

# Challenge 1:

# Write a program that calculates the average of three exam scores stored in variables.

# Challenge 2:

# def calculate_avg(score1,score2,score3):
#     total = score1 + score2 + score3
#     avg = total / 3
#     return avg

# print(calculate_avg(1,2,3))

# Create a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints out a message including both pieces of information.
